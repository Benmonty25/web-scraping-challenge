# web-scraping-challenge

This repo consists of a jupyter notebook, a scraper file, an application and html for scraping https://redplanetscience.com/, https://spaceimages-mars.com/, and https://galaxyfacts-mars.com/. 

The combination of this data is scraped into the scraper.py file and managed by the app.py file. The html file this references the app.py file to source the data. The use of Mongo DB as a local database allow this to run from a network.
